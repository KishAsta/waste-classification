# waste-classification
This project presents an automated waste classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with advanced image preprocessing techniques to enhance object detection and classification accuracy. Effective waste segregation is essential for efficient recycling and sustainable waste management, and deep learning-based approaches can significantly improve this process. The dataset consists of images categorized into recyclable and non-recyclable waste, including cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and general trash. To improve model performance, preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, color saturation enhancement, and edge detection are applied, along with contour-based object detection to filter out images without identifiable waste objects. A CNN model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, incorporating data augmentation, batch normalization, dropout layers, and adaptive learning rate scheduling to optimize accuracy and prevent overfitting. Additionally, transfer learning with MobileNetV2 is leveraged for efficient feature extraction, while early stopping mechanisms ensure optimal training without excessive computation. The final trained model demonstrates high classification accuracy and can be integrated into smart waste management systems for automated sorting and recycling. This approach contributes to environmental sustainability by enabling efficient waste segregation, reducing manual labor, and facilitating real-time deployment in smart cities and IoT-based waste monitoring systems. Future improvements could include deployment on embedded edge devices and integration with robotic sorting mechanisms for fully automated waste management solutions.
